# UMD-Inventory-Project
Created by Adam Kenney

## NOTE:
The repository does not contain the API keys or information, and the program does not run without it. The application allows you to make changes to a google sheet used by the IT
department at the University of Maryland. The purpose of this github repo is to show off the source code, view the video below for a look at the program in production.

## Project Description:
This project was part of my internship at the University of Maryland where I worked with one of the heads of the IT department to complete a variety of projects. In this project,
I was tasked to create an application that will take in a bunch of data from a massive google sheet that contained a whole bunch of data dumped from the university's network 
security softwares, and filter out the useful information and find useful statistics. I used Google APIs to connect to the database through NodeJS, and this allowed me to query all
of the data as well as update it. This front end is built using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. All styling is done with normal CSS, with no special frameworks. Each page is 
made using custom HTML elements, similar to how a ReactJS project works, but implemented in vanilla Javascript.
